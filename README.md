# Chatbot
Abstract:

This project showcases a chatbot application developed using Java and Modern Android Development (MAD) tools, designed to provide users with an interactive conversational experience. The chatbot answers queries and performs simple tasks using natural language processing. Utilizing Java's features and Android Studioâ€™s interface, it offers real-time responses and a customizable UI. The integration of machine learning enables the chatbot to learn from interactions, enhancing response accuracy over time. This project illustrates the effectiveness of Java and MAD in creating mobile applications and lays the groundwork for future enhancements, such as voice recognition.
